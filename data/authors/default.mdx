Jesper is a nerd in may aspects. He likes computers (especially old ones), 
he likes cars (especially old ones) and photographs a lot.

## Passion

Cars have always been my passion (at least as long as I remember). 
First it was the technical stuff like speed and power. 
Now it is more the beauty of the designs, and the history behind the brands. 
There is no need to say that I follow the evolution of cars closely in the media.

First of all I like italian cars. The designs of Pininfarina are great. 
Of course the designs for Ferrari are important, but the prototypes and the 
designs for Alfa Romeo are excelent. In fact I have had a car myself that had 
Pininfarina designs in it: Austin 1300 Salon. A nice car, but not exactly a Ferrari!

## Origin of Rasta
Well - rasta is as you might have guessed, not my real name. 
It is my handle and goes way back to the good old amiga days. 
Why rasta? I think (!) it was a combination of many things. 
The catoon by Hergé called Tintin, for example, has a criminal with a similar name. 
And the name was introduced when I was trying to do some graphics for a little 
demo group (doing amiga demos) called fieldeffect (rasta = raster - get it?). 
We actually didn't do much, but it was trendy at the time to be part of a 
demo group (at least in the nerd world). And having a nice handle was even more nice.

## Rastafari
Believing that africa is the spiritual home of the black race, 
to which it one day will return to. Evilness and the white world is often 
spoken of as "babylon" while Haile Selassie I, who became the emperor of 
Ethiopia in 1930, is the new saviour. Rastafari is a life concept consisting 
of elements of both christianity, islam, and nature worships and rastafari 
has played a large role in jamaica since the 1960's.
