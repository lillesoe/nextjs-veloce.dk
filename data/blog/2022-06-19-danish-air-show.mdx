## 07:00 Ports and exibitions open

Before the show started there was a nice exibition to have a look at. I came early (to avoid trafic jam) and 
had some time to inspect the nice hardware on display.

Some of the planes on exibition were also represented in the air.
So you could both study the details, and the performance and sound.
