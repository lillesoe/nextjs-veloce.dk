The danish television (DRTV) has put a lot of their old material in digital form on the net. Visit [Bonanza](https://www.dr.dk/bonanza) to see it from you browser (if you are from Denmark).

But I want to watch it on my Apple TV :-)

That is where XBMC comes in. Just add it via the [Add-on manager](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-ons) in XBMC.
