[Code:](http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=161&amp;t=128542#) In a terminal...

To add the software source: `sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ehoover/compholio`

To update to software list: `sudo apt update`

To get Netflix, and all its dependencies: `sudo apt-get install netflix-desktop`

After I did the above, I went to my menu launcher and typed 'netf' in the search field and it pulled up 'netflix-desktop'. I clicked on it and the Netflix GUI, typical of any other Netflix GUI, opened. I chose my video, after signing in, and the playback was at least as good as in Windows. Personally, I saw no difference in performance, at all.
