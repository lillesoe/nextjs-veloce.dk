Finally - need to find time to upgrade my NAS.

Some of the nice new features are

- Updated version (28) of ZFS
- High performance SSH
- new installer bsdinstall

I especially look forward to the new version of ZFS - maybe I can get rid of geli 
which I installed because WD disks have 4k sectors and ZFS had terrible performance
with that. So geli translated those 4k sectors into 515 bytes sectors.
